# 'Dice and Lattes' Board Game Cafe, Cearphilly
### An assessed project for the Code Institute

Dice and Lattes is a new cafe in the heart of Caerphilly which doesn't just offer **exceptional** coffes, **responsibly sourced**, but also invites you to sit and enjoy a game with friends. 

Alongside the extensive and growing collection of **board games**, our **Game Experts** will assist with game learning and make recommendations appropriate to guests requirements (such as player number and skill). Furthermore, excellent customer service through teaching these games to customer will keep people wanting to come and game!

## User Experience and Design

The needs of the **business owners**, and **customers** have been considered in the designing phase of this project. These have been summerised into the following user stories:

### User Stories:
As a **business owner** I want a website so that I can expose my business more. In doing this our aims are that:
* More people know about the business locally.
* The concept is easily and clearly explained.
* Customers can find the cafe and contact us. 
* A focus on the menu as well as games.
* The website is attractive and intuitive to potential customers. 
* There is a way to book tables and sell games. 

As a **customer** I want a website to understand what makes this cafe special. To do this I need:
* Information on what is different about this cafe, easily digestible and clearly explained. 
* Information about the menu and pricing. 
* Information about how to find and contaxct the cafe. 
* To be able to book tables direct from the website. 

### High level Needs and Trade-offs:

There are several identified needs from these stories. In dicussion with the client, these were ranked from most to least important:

1. An attractive and well designed website. 
2. Information about the business incluing the concept, location and contact details. 
3. A way to contact the cafe from the website.
4. A shop where you can purchase games and pre-book tables.
5. A menu and pricing information. 
6. A gallery page.

These were taken and assessed agains the limitations of time and buget, and given related viability / feasability score (opportunity numbers relate to above):


| Opportunity      | Importance    | Viability     |
| :-------------:   | :----------:  | :-----------: |
| 1                | 5             | 5              |
| 2                | 5             | 5              |
| 3                | 4             | 5              |
| 4                | 4             | 1              |
| 5                | 3             | 5              |
| 6                | 2             | 4              |


From this exercise it was clear that there needed to be some compromise on the scope of the project. It was agreed that the most viable elements scored as a 5 should be those to make up the initial release of the website, wiht the online shop to be a feature held back until a future release of the website. 

Therefore, the key requirements of the initial website were:
* An attractive and well designed website. 
* Information about the business incluing the concept, location and contact details. 
* A way to contact the cafe from the website.
* A menu and pricing information.
